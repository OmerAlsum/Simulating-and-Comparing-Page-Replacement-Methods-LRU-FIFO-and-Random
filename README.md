# Simulating-and-Comparing-Page-Replacement-Methods-LRU-FIFO-and-Random

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the three different page replacement schemes: FIFO or oldest page replacement, random replacement, and least recently used. The programming language, C++ will be used. The cache will have fully associative mapping meaning that the page can be placed in any spot of the cache and have 5 spots.

It is found that given the pagelog {49,50,50,52,30,49,43,49,20,31,26,37,43,43,43,43,43,20,20,30,21,25,25,25,25,25,25,31,20,20,11,11,11,12,12,49,43,50,50,20,11,43,50,12,12,49,43,50,50,50}, least recently used has a hit ratio of 64%, random has a hit ratio of 55.64%, and Oldest page has a hit ratio of 66%.
